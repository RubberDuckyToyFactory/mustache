# Mustache Game 
A Classic Concentration type game to learn English language pronouns.

This game is the result of me trying to help my kids learn the different types of pronouns in the English language.  
Secretly it was also to help me.  

The game plays similarly to the game Classic Concentation where you flip over cards to find a match.
In this version of the game you flip over cards to reveal a pronoun.  the player has to determine if the two pronouns are of the say type; 
for example, _Any_ and _Those_ do not match because they are _indefinite_ and _demonstrative_ pronouns respectively.  

You can play the game on its GitHub Pages at https://rubberduckytoyfactory.github.io/mustache/.
